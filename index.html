        <p>
            Hello There! Welcome to the stepping stones project. Our goal is to make it easier for people to find services they need at their stage of life.
            We understand how frustrating this process can be, and we commend you for the courage it took to start making the journey to a better life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Select which of the following apply to you, and we will be able to suggest accessible services that you may find helpful. 
            With the exception of our housing suggestions, all services mentioned here are free of charge.
            Do note that these are only suggestions. Do not feel required to follow them exactly, immediately, or even at all. 
            It's your life. Take the actions you feel comfortable taking when you feel comfortable taking them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, rest assured that there are no pre-requsites for using this website. No matter where you are, we will
            try our best to suggest simple, actionable steps you can take. (Yes, that means we can help you get ID even if you
            don't have a single piece on you).
        </p>
